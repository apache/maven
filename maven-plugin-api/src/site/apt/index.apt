Maven 3 Plugin API

 The API for Maven 3 plugins - composed of goals implemented by Mojos - development:

 * goal code extends {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/AbstractMojo.html}<<<AbstractMojo>>> base class}} that implements {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/Mojo.html}<<<Mojo>>> interface}},

 * {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/logging/Log.html}<<<Log>>> interface}} provides easy logging for the goal.

 []

 A plugin is described in a {{{./plugin.html}<<<META-INF/maven/plugin.xml>>> plugin descriptor}},
 generally generated from plugin sources using {{{/plugin-tools/maven-plugin-plugin/}maven-plugin-plugin}}.
