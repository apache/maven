Maven Settings Model

 This is the model for Maven settings in <<<org.apache.maven.settings>>> package,
 delegating content to {{{../api/maven-api-settings/index.html}Maven 4 API immutable settings}}. All the effective model
 building logic from multiple settings files is done in {{{../maven-settings-builder/}Maven Settings Builder}}.

 The following are generated from this model:

   * {{{./apidocs/index.html}Java sources}} with Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser, <<<ToAPiV3()>>> and <<<ToApiV4()>>> transformers, and <<<v4>>> package
     for Merger and v4 Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser,

   * A {{{./settings.html}Descriptor Reference}}

   * An {{{https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.2.0.xsd}XSD}}

* See Also User Documentation

  * {{{https://maven.apache.org/settings.html} Settings Reference}},

  * {{{https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html} Mirror Settings}},
