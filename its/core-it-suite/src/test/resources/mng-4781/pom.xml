  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-4781</name>
  <description>Verify that deployment to a Nexus-like staging repository works. The subtle difference compared to an ordinary
    HTTP/WebDAV server is that those staging repos yield a HTTP 400 (and not 404) for every GET request until a
    PUT request is made (which initializes the staging repo). The bottom line is that remote metadata must not be
    requested before the first artifact is deployed.</description>
