  This is an invalid repositories section (missing <repository> element), which would trip up the model parser 
  if it were used in strict mode, or if the handling of the strict-mode flag 
  doesn't apply to association lists.

  Dependency POMs should always be parsed in non-strict mode, so this
  shouldn't prevent the inclusion of the above dependency.
