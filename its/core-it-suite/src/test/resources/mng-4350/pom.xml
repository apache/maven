  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-4350</name>
  <description>
    Test that multiple goals bound to the same phase by a lifecycle mapping execute in the order given by
    the lifecycle mapping. In particular, the order of plugin declarations in the POM should have no influence
    on the lifecycle mappings specified by the packaging.

        <!--
        NOTE: The packaging provided by this plugin defines a lifecycle mapping which maps a goal from the Resources
        Plugin and a goal from the plugin itself, in that order, to the same phase. This order must be retained
        during the build regardless of the POM order of the plugin declarations which is just the opposite ordering.
