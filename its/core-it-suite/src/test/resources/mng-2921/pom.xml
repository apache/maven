  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-2921 :: Parent</name>
  <description>Verify that attached project artifacts can be resolved from the reactor as active project artifacts for
    consumption on other module's class paths. Note the subtle difference of this test compared to the closely
    related issue MNG-2871: This test is about *attached* artifacts, i.e. dependencies that have already been
    packaged. MNG-2871 on the other hand is about dependencies that haven't been packaged yet but merely exist
    as loose class files in a module's output directory.</description>
