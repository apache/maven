  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-3853</name>
  <description>
    Verify that distribution management repos injected by profiles are recognized by the MavenProject instance and
    that the resulting artifact repositories are available to plugins via the corresponding expressions. Note that
    this issue is not primarily about the effective model (which was correct for the original issue, i.e. reflected
    the injected distributionManagement section) but whether the MavenProject wrapper around the model is in sync
    with the model.
