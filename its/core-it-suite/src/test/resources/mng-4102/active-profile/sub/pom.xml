  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-4102 :: Child</name>
  <description>Verify that the effective value of an inherited property reflects the values of any nested property
    as defined by the child. This boils down to the order of inheritance and (parent) interpolation.
    This variation of the test has active profiles in parent and child (which should make no difference
    to the result).</description>
