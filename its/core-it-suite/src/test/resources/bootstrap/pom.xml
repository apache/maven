    <name>Maven Integration Test :: Boostrap</name>
    <description>
        This project pulls down all the artifacts/plugins required for the IT suite. Due to MNG-2974, snapshot versions of
        plugins cannot be downloaded by Maven from non-default repositories configured in the POM if the plugin is invoked
        directly from the command line. Also, having this in a central place spares us from copying the snapshot repo
        config all around in the IT POMs.
