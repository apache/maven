  <description>Verify that locally reachable parent POMs of projects in the reactor can be resolved during dependency
    resolution even if a parent itself is not part of the reactor.</description>

    <!--
    The POM for mod-b inherits from reactor-parent which inherits from top-parent. The latter is not part of
    the reactor build. Failure to resolve top-parent will cause the model building for mod-b to fail as well,
    which in turn makes all dependencies of mod-b inaccessible to this project.
