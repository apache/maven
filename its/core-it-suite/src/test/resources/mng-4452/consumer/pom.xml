  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-4452 :: Dependency Consumer</name>
  <description>Test that snapshot artifacts with classifiers can be successfully resolved from remote repos with (unique
    snapshots) when the last deployment to that repo didn't include that particular classifier. In other words,
    the metadata in the repository needs to properly keep track of all snapshots and not just the last deployed
    one. The same goes for snapshots that differ only by file extension.</description>
