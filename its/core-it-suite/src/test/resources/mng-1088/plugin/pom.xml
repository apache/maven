  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-1088 :: Plugin</name>
  <description>Test that the plugin manager falls back to resolution from the repository if a plugin is part of the reactor
    (i.e. an active project artifact) but the lifecycle has not been executed far enough to produce a file for
    the plugin (i.e. a phase before "compile").</description>
