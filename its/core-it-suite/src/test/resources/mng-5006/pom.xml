  <description>Verify that resolution of parent POMs of dependencies that use a version range is not restricted to the
    repository from which the specific dependency version was picked. Or put differently, the fact that a:0.1
    was found in repo-1 does not mean parents/dependencies of a:0.1 are also located in that same repo, they
    could be in any of the originally declared repos.</description>
