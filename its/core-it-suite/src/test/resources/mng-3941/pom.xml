  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-3941</name>
  <description>Test that the execution project from a forked lifecycle does not leak into mojos that run after the mojo
    that forked the lifecycle. While this is rather irrelevant for Maven's core itself, this enforces proper
    mojo programming, i.e. a mojo should not access the execution project unless it forked the lifecycle.</description>
