  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-4528</name>
  <description>Test that wagon providers pulled in via transitive dependencies of Maven core artifacts get excluded from
    plugin realms (in favor of potentially newer wagons bundled with the core). This requirement is mostly a
    hack to compensate for the historic slip of Maven core artifacts depending on wagon providers. Those old
    wagon providers conflict with the usually newer wagons bundled with the core distro and cause grief under
    a class loader hierarchy where wagons are loaded from the plugin realm (if available) like in Maven 3.</description>

            This Maven core artifact has a dependency on wagon-ssh-external:1.0-alpha-6 but this wagon version
            must not be used by the plugin. In real projects, the constellation
            maven-core:2.0.6 -> wagon-lightweight-http:1.0-beta-2 is most problematic.
