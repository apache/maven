  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-2098</name>
  <description>Test that the selected version from a version range can be successfully resolved even if the repository
    with the newest metadata does not provide the selected version. In particular, the repository with the
    newest metadata must not be the only repository used during artifact resolution, all repositories must
    be considered.</description>
