  <name>Maven Integration Test :: MNG-4269</name>
  <description>Test that dependency resolution from the reactor is not too eager and does not resolve plugin artifacts from
    the build directory of their plugin project when the plugin project hasn't been built yet. The technical
    problem is that the mere existence of a project output directory like target/classes is no sufficient indicator
    that we can use that for artifact resolution. The project's output directory might just be a left over from a
    previous build and could be in any state, e.g. incomplete.</description>
