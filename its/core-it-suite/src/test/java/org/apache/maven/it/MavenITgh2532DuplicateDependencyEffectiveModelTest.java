/**
 * This is a test set for <a href="https://github.com/apache/maven/issues/2532">GH-2532</a>.
 * <p>
 * The issue occurs when a project has duplicate dependencies in the effective model due to
 * property placeholders in dependency coordinates. Before the fix, deduplication was performed
 * before interpolation, causing dependencies like {@code scalatest_${scala.binary.version}} and
 * {@code scalatest_2.13} to be seen as different dependencies. After interpolation, they become
 * the same dependency, leading to a "duplicate dependency" error during the build.
 * <p>
 * The fix moves the deduplication step to after interpolation, ensuring that dependencies with
 * property placeholders are properly deduplicated after their values are resolved.
 * @since 4.0.0-rc-3

     * Tests that a project with dependencies using property placeholders in artifact coordinates
     * can be built successfully without "duplicate dependency" errors when the same dependency
     * appears in multiple places in the effective model.
     * <p>
     * This test reproduces the scenario where:
     * <ul>
     * <li>A dependency is defined with a property placeholder in the artifactId (e.g., scalatest_${scala.binary.version})</li>
     * <li>The same dependency appears in parent and child modules</li>
     * <li>The maven-shade-plugin is used, which triggers the duplicate dependency check</li>
     * </ul>
     * Before the fix, deduplication happened before interpolation, so scalatest_${scala.binary.version}
     * and scalatest_2.13 were seen as different dependencies. After interpolation, they become the same,
     * causing a "duplicate dependency" error during the shade goal.
     * <p>
     * The fix moves deduplication to after interpolation, ensuring proper deduplication.
