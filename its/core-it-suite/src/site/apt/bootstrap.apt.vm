Maven Core Integration Tests Bootstrap

  Core IT Bootstrapping downloads from Central repository every dependency (artifacts, plugins) required to let
  Core ITs Suite run without downloading anything later (see {{{./index.html#Core_ITs_Suite_and_Dependencies_.28incl._Plugins.29}Core ITs Suite and dependencies}} rationale).
  
  Content to download is defined in {{{https://github.com/apache/maven-integration-testing/tree/master/core-it-suite/src/test/resources/bootstrap}a series of bootstrap projects}}:
