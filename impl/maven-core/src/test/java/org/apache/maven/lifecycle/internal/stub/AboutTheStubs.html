    <title>About these stubs</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Design</h2>
These stubs can be thought of as hand-coded mock objects. They allow unit tests to test only specific
aspects of a component while ignoring others.

These stubs form an internally consistent data-set that is not expected to change. They are
used to test the individual components in the lifecycle with data that has expected characteristics
and can be asserted as desired.

You can change/extend these stubs, and tests should not be breaking too much, since most tests
assert using expected values from the stubs. Normally, when you try to use data from the stubs that
have not been properly populated, you'll get a nullpointer in your test and you then have to
identify which stub creates that specific piece of data.

The most important stubs are:
LifecycleExecutionPlanCalculatorStub
ProjectDependencyGraphStub

Since they define the primary structure of the project/build.

The stubs define three top-level targets that are defined in  LifecycleTaskSegmentCalculatorStub;
clean, aggr and install. "aggr" is an aggregating task while clean and install are lifecyclephases.
There will be three items in the task list for this dataset.

The stubs also exist at different "levels", where one test might wire stubs into a specific live implementation.
In the next test that same "live implementation" will be used in a stub version instead.

Not all live services have stubs, but can be added as needed.
