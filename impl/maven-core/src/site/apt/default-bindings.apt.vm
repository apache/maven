Plugins Bindings for <<<default>>> Lifecycle Reference

  The {{{./lifecycles.html}<<<default>>> lifecycle}} is defined without any plugin binding; plugins bindings are defined separately
  in {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/lifecycle/providers/packaging/package-summary.html}<<<org.apache.maven.lifecycle.providers.packaging>>>}} package
  because they are specific for each packaging:

%{toc|fromDepth=2}

  Versions of the plugins are shared in a few constants:

%{snippet|id=versions|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/lifecycle/providers/packaging/AbstractLifecycleMappingProvider.java}

%{snippet|id=pom|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/lifecycle/providers/packaging/PomLifecycleMappingProvider.java}

* Plugin bindings for <<<jar>>> packaging

%{snippet|id=jar|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/lifecycle/providers/packaging/JarLifecycleMappingProvider.java}
