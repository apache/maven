* <<<clean>>> Lifecycle

  <<<clean>>> lifecycle phases are defined with their plugins bindings:

%{snippet|id=clean|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/lifecycle/providers/CleanLifecycleProvider.java}

* <<<site>>> Lifecycle

  <<<site>>> lifecycle phases are defined with their plugins bindings:

%{snippet|id=site|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/lifecycle/providers/SiteLifecycleProvider.java}
