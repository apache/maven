BOOTSTRAPPING BASICS
-----------------------

You'll need:

- Java 1.4
- Ant 1.6.5 or later

First, give Ant a location into which the completed Maven distro should be installed:

    export M2_HOME=$HOME/apps/maven/apache-maven-2.1-SNAPSHOT

Then, run Ant:

    ant

Once the build completes, you should have a new Maven distro ready to roll in your $M2_HOME directory!

Enjoy.
