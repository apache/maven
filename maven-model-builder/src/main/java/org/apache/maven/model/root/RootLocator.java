/**
 * Interface used to locate the root directory for a given project.
 *
 * The root locator is usually looked up from the plexus container.
 * One notable exception is the computation of the early {@code session.rootDirectory}
 * property which happens very early.  The implementation used in this case
 * will be discovered using the JDK service mechanism.
 *
 * The default implementation will look for a {@code .mvn} child directory
 * or a {@code pom.xml} containing the {@code root="true"} attribute.
 *
 * @see DefaultRootLocator
 * @deprecated use {@link org.apache.maven.api.services.ModelBuilder} instead
