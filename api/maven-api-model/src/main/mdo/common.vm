## The following loop code is required in order to change the type of the
## pomFile attribute to a java.nio.file.Path.  Modello does not support this
## type and loading a model with such a type would fail the modello validation.
##
#foreach ( $field in $model.getClass("Model", $version).allFields )
  #if ( $field.name == "pomFile" )
    #set ( $dummy = $field.setType("java.nio.file.Path") )
  #end
#end
#set ( $locationTracking = true )
