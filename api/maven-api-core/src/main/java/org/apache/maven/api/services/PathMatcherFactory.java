/**
 * Service for creating {@link PathMatcher} objects that can be used to filter files
 * based on include/exclude patterns. This service provides a clean API for plugins
 * to create path matchers without directly depending on implementation classes.
 * <p>
 * The path matchers created by this service support Maven's traditional include/exclude
 * pattern syntax, which is compatible with the behavior of Maven 3 plugins like
 * maven-compiler-plugin and maven-clean-plugin.
 * <p>
 * Pattern syntax supports:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Standard glob patterns with {@code *}, {@code ?}, and {@code **} wildcards</li>
 *   <li>Explicit syntax prefixes like {@code "glob:"} or {@code "regex:"}</li>
 *   <li>Maven 3 compatible behavior for patterns without explicit syntax</li>
 *   <li>Default exclusion patterns for SCM files when requested</li>
 * </ul>
