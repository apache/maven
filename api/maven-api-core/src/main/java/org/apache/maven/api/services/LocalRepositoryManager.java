/**
 * Manages the organization and access of artifacts within the local Maven repository.
 * The local repository serves as a cache for downloaded remote artifacts and storage
 * for locally installed artifacts. This manager provides services to determine the
 * appropriate paths for artifacts within the local repository structure.
 *
 * <p>The LocalRepositoryManager is responsible for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Determining the storage path for locally installed artifacts</li>
 *   <li>Managing the layout and organization of cached remote artifacts</li>
 *   <li>Maintaining consistency in artifact storage patterns</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This interface is part of Maven's repository management system and works in
 * conjunction with {@link RemoteRepository} and {@link LocalRepository} to provide
 * a complete artifact resolution and storage solution.
