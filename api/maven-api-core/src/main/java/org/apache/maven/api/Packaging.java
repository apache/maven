/**
 * Represents the packaging of a Maven project.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Packaging} class defines the type of artifact that a Maven project produces during the build process.
 * The packaging type determines the structure of the project's output and how Maven will treat the resulting artifact.</p>
 *
 * <p>Common packaging types include {@code jar}, {@code war}, {@code pom}, {@code maven-plugin}, {@code ear}, and others.
 * These types influence various aspects of the build lifecycle, such as which plugins are executed and how dependencies are managed.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@code Packaging} class is an immutable value object, ensuring that once a packaging type is defined, it cannot be changed.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Standard Packaging Types</h2>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code jar}: Packages the project as a Java Archive (JAR) file.</li>
 *     <li>{@code war}: Packages the project as a Web Application Archive (WAR) file.</li>
 *     <li>{@code pom}: Indicates that the project does not produce a deployable artifact but is used for dependency management or as an aggregator.</li>
 *     <li>{@code maven-plugin}: Packages the project as a Maven plugin.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Session session = ... // Obtain a Maven session
 * Packaging packaging = session.requirePackaging("jar");
 * System.out.println(packaging.getId()); // Outputs "jar"
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see org.apache.maven.api.Session#requirePackaging(String)

 * @see org.apache.maven.api.model.Model#getPackaging()
