 * Collects problems that are encountered during model building. The primary purpose of this component is to account for
 * the fact that the problem reporter has/should not have information about the calling context and hence cannot provide
 * an expressive source hint for the model problem. Instead, the source hint is configured by the model builder before
 * it delegates to other components that potentially encounter problems. Then, the problem reporter can focus on
 * providing a simple error message, leaving the donkey work of creating a nice model problem to this component.
