/**
 *
 * Note: uses @Typed to limit the types it is available for injection to just ModelProcessor.
 *
 * This is because the ModelProcessor interface extends ModelLocator and ModelReader. If we
 * made this component available under all its interfaces then it could end up being injected
 * into itself leading to a stack overflow.
 *
 * A side-effect of using @Typed is that it translates to explicit bindings in the container.
 * So instead of binding the component under a 'wildcard' key it is now bound with an explicit
 * key. Since this is a default component this will be a plain binding of ModelProcessor to
 * this implementation type, ie. no hint/name.
 *
 * This leads to a second side-effect in that any @Inject request for just ModelProcessor in
 * the same injector is immediately matched to this explicit binding, which means extensions
 * cannot override this binding. This is because the lookup is always short-circuited in this
 * specific situation (plain @Inject request, and plain explicit binding for the same type.)
 *
 * The simplest solution is to use a custom @Named here so it isn't bound under the plain key.
 * This is only necessary for default components using @Typed that want to support overriding.
 *
 * As a non-default component this now gets a negative priority relative to other implementations
 * of the same interface. Since we want to allow overriding this doesn't matter in this case.
 * (if it did we could add @Priority of 0 to match the priority given to default components.)
 *
 * @deprecated use {@link org.apache.maven.api.services.ModelBuilder} instead
