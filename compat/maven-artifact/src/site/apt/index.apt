Maven Artifact

 Maven Artifact classes, providing <<<Artifact>>> interface ({{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/artifact/Artifact.html}javadoc}}),
 with its <<<DefaultArtifact>>> implementation ({{{./xref/org/apache/maven/artifact/DefaultArtifact.html}source}}).

 The jar file is executable and provides a little tool to display how Maven parses and compares versions:

+----+
$ java -jar maven-artifact-*.jar 3.2.4-alpha-1 3.2.4-SNAPSHOT 3.2.4.0
Display parameters as parsed by Maven (in canonical form) and comparison result:
1. 3.2.4-alpha-1 == 3.2.4.alpha.1
   3.2.4-alpha-1 < 3.2.4-SNAPSHOT
2. 3.2.4-SNAPSHOT == 3.2.4.snapshot
   3.2.4-SNAPSHOT < 3.2.4.0
3. 3.2.4.0 == 3.2.4
+----+

* Useful entry points

 * artifact version comparison {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/artifact/versioning/ComparableVersion.html}javadoc}},

 * {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/artifact/versioning/VersionRange.html}version range}}.
