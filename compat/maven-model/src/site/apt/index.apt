Maven Model

 This is strictly the model for Maven POM (Project Object Model) in <<<org.apache.maven.model>>> package,
 delegating content to {{{../api/maven-api-model/index.html}Maven 4 API immutable model}}. All the effective model
 building logic from multiple POMs and building context is done in {{{../maven-model-builder/}Maven Model Builder}}.

 The following are generated from this model:

   * {{{./apidocs/index.html}Java sources}} with Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser, <<<ToAPiV3()>>> and <<<ToApiV4()>>> transformers, and <<<v4>>> package
     for Merger and v4 Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser,

   * A {{{./maven.html}Descriptor Reference}}

   * An XSD {{{https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-v3_0_0.xsd}for Maven 1.1}} and {{{https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd}for Maven 2.0}}.
