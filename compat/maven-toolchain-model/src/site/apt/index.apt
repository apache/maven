Maven Toolchain Model

 This is the model for Maven toolchain in <<<org.apache.maven.toolchain>>> package,
 delegating content to {{{../api/maven-api-toolchain/index.html}Maven 4 API immutable toolchain}}. All the effective model
 building logic from multiple toolchains files is done in {{{../maven-toolchain-builder/}Maven Toolchain Builder}}.

 The following are generated from this model:

   * {{{./apidocs/index.html}Java sources}} with Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser, <<<ToAPiV3()>>> and <<<ToApiV4()>>> transformers, and <<<v4>>> package
     for Merger and v4 Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser,

   * A {{{./toolchains.html}Descriptor Reference}}

   * An {{{https://maven.apache.org/xsd/toolchains-1.1.0.xsd}XSD}}
