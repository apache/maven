    <section name="Apache Maven 4.x">

      <p>Maven is a project development management and
    comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model:
    builds, dependency management, documentation creation, site
    publication, and distribution publication are all controlled from
    <a href="./maven-model/maven.html">the <code>pom.xml</code> declarative file</a>. Maven can be extended by
    <a href="https://maven.apache.org/plugins/">plugins</a> to utilise a
    number of other development tools for reporting or the build
    process.</p>
